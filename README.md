At the time I'm writing this, the only development board I can find for sale which utilises the B variant of the RP2350 *and* breaks out all of the extra ADCs it offers, is the [Pimoroni PGA2350](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pga2350?variant=42092629229651), however it is not a breadboard compatible.  
This board adapts the PGA2350 to allow it to be used for Eurorack development with a breadboard, breaking out all required connections including routing Eurorack power from a standard header to pin headers which can be connected to a breadboard's rails using jumper wire.  
The USB connections are arranged so that an [Adafruit USB Micro-B Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1833) (also sold by [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-usb-micro-b-breakout-board?variant=821196557)) can be soldered direcly to the board.

*NOTE: The first PCB order for these boards was placed on 02.09.2024 but has not arrived yet. I would not recommend ordering boards while this message is present as they have not been tested*
