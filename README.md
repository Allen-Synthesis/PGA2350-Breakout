# PGA2350-breakout
### Breakout board for the Pimoroni PGA2350 for Eurorack breadboard development

As of time of writing, the only development board I can find which utilises the B variant of the RP2350 is the [Pimoroni PGA2350](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pga2350?variant=42092629229651), however it is not a breadboard compatible. This board adapts the PGA2350 to allow it to be used for Eurorack development with a breadboard, breaking out all required connections including routing Eurorack power from a standard header to pin headers which can be connected to a breadboard's rails using jumper wire.

*NOTE: The first PCB order for these boards was placed on 02.09.2024 but has not arrived yet. I would not recommend ordering boards while this message is present as they have not been tested*
